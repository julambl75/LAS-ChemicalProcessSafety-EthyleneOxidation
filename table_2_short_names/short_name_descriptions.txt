(1 ) We include as failure data the 5 "trivial" failures — these can be detected at the location in the process where they occur: lowPressure_source, highTemp_source, lowTemp_source, highTemp_coolingWater, lowTemp_coolingWater
(2 ) We include as failure data 6 "nontrivial" failures [default setting] — these must be detected by measuring the consequences of a failure: missingEthylene_source, lowSetpoint_flowControlLoop, lowSetpoint_tempControlLoop, leak_beforeCompressor, lowPressure_coolingWater, stuckClosed_coolingWaterOutValve
(3 ) We include as failure data 10 "nontrivial" failures: highSetpoint_flowControlLoop, highSetpoint_tempControlLoop, leak_beforeCompressor, lowSetpoint_flowControlLoop, lowSetpoint_tempControlLoop, missingEthylene_source, missingOxygen_source, stuckClosed_coolingWaterOutValve, stuckClosed_tempControlValve, stuckOpen_tempControlValve
(4 ) We include as failure data the above 10 "nontrivial" failures, and also use the full set of data rather than only 75 runs per failure

(5 ) We only use 10 runs per failure from the dataset (split between training and evaluation)
(6 ) We only use 25 runs per failure from the dataset
(7 ) We only use 50 runs per failure from the dataset
(8 ) We only use 75 runs per failure from the dataset [default setting]
(9 ) We use all 125 runs per failure from the dataset

(10) We use the short-term data from t=2s for training and evaluation
(11) We use the short-term data from t=4s for training and evaluation
(12) We use the short-term data from t=6s for training and evaluation [default setting]
(13) We use the short-term data from t=10s for training and evaluation
(14) We use the short-term data from t=20s for training and evaluation

(15) We include all process parameters as model variables
(16) We include the following "real-world" process parameters as model variables: e2_tsi, e2_tti, k1_p1, m1_pv, m2_pv, m3_pv, r1_t2, snk1_p, snk1_t, srcr1_p, srcr1_t
(17) We include the process parameters from the flow and temperature control loops as model variables: m1_pv, m2_pv
