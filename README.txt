# Data

The data/ folder contains three files:
- component_order.csv: used by T_static to determine upstream components
- static.csv: data for T_static, to be split into train and validation
- dynamic.csv: data for T_dynamic, to be split into train and validation

# Confusion Matrices

The confusion_matrices/ folder contains one subdirectory for each of the subsets of experiments considered. In each one, we provide the confusion matrices for the baselines and for T_dynamic, along with a labels.txt file that contains the mapping from class indices to experiment labels.
